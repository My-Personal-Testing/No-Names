# No-Names

Used https://readwrite.com/2015/11/16/how-to-build-an-api-amazon-lambda/ to learn some basics of building an API. Already have some experience with npm/node installations to run through command line. Couldn't get the zip script to run, so I zipped the file manually.

Used https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/getting-started-with-node-js-and-mocha to help adjust for Windows
and get the mocha test to work properly.

Watched at least half of the "Learning Cloud Computing: Serverless Computing" course on Lynda.com.
